JAL Audit Plugin (jalauditd)

INTRODUCTION

	jalauditd is a JAL plugin for audisp. The plugin connects to a JALoP 
	socket and upon receiving audit messages from audisp, parses the
	messages and formats them into JALoP structures. After the audit
	messages have been parsed and structured, the plugin sends the data
	to the JALoP logger for further processing.

	The plugin consists of a binary installed to /sbin, an audisp config
	file installed to /etc/audisp/plugins.d, and a jalauditd config file
	installed to /etc/jalauditd. The installation prefix can be changed by
	setting PREFIX when building.

	The binary's location is known to audisp through the audisp config file.
	Other than the binary path, no other option within this file should be 
	changed.

	The jalauditd config file is initially blank and can take only 4
	options, socket, schemas, keypath, and certpath. These parameters must be 
	formatted in the following way:

		socket = "/path/to/jalop/socket";
		schemas = "/path/to/schemas/root";
		keypath = "/path/to/key";
		certpath = "/path/to/cert";

	The socket and schemas options, if not specified, with default to the locations specified
	by the JAL producer library.  If keypath or certpath are not specified, no key or cert will
	be used for signing.
